🚀 Multi-Agent Collaboration System with Gemini & LangChain

I recently built a Multi-Agent System powered by Google Gemini (via LangChain) to simulate collaboration between multiple AI agents, each with a specific role in problem-solving.

💡 Project Idea
Instead of relying on a single model to handle everything, I designed a pipeline of specialized agents that work together step by step:

1️⃣ Research Agent – gathers raw, unprocessed information related to the user’s query.
2️⃣ Summarizer Agent – condenses the research into key points for better understanding.
3️⃣ Reasoning Agent – analyzes the summary, applies logical reasoning, and connects it back to the original question.
4️⃣ Decision Agent – refines the reasoning into a final, clear, and user-friendly answer.

⚙️ Tech Stack Used

LangChain for prompt orchestration

Gemini (Google Generative AI) as the core LLM

Python for implementation

📌 Example Use Case
When asked: “What is the role of LSTM in machine translation compared to Transformer?”

Research Agent collects raw info.

Summarizer Agent extracts main differences.

Reasoning Agent analyzes performance trade-offs.

Decision Agent provides a clear, concise final explanation.

✨ This project demonstrates how multi-agent collaboration can improve AI workflows, making responses more structured, accurate, and human-like.
